This folder contains face detection data (per individual face) for each received image:

e.g. ->
Original image: 12345678.jpg
Individual faces dectected in original image:
Face 1: 12345678-1.jpg
Face 2: 12345678-2.jpg
Face 3: 12345678-3.jpg

etc...

These files will sit here until a request matching the filename ("timestamp"-"face_id".jpg)  comes into the '/tag' endpoint, at which 
time the files are processed into a face profile with tagging data.
